# A note about screenshot tools
Some students have been submitting images where you take a picture of the your computer screen on your phone. I'd like to encourage you to move away from this as in the workplace, this would not necessarily be considered professional.

Please consider the following screeshot tools that you can use for your submissions instead. If you need assistance learning how to use these tools please let me know. We will also be touching them briefly in class.

# Windows
[Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/)

# MacOS
[Shottr](https://shottr.cc/)
