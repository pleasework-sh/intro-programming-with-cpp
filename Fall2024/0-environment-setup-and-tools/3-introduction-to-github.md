# Introduction to GitHub
For saving our code and submitting assignments, we will be using GitHub. 

Please go ahead and create a GitHub account by visiting [github.com](https://github.com).

Make it a habit to store all of your code in GitHub moving forward so in the future you can look back at all of the programs you have written.
