# Fall 2024 - CSC114 Introduction

# Meeting times and room number
We meet Thursdays in Room E411 from 5 - 9:50PM.

# Learning philosophy  
This course is designed to get you as much practice as possible without stressing about exams or quizzes. My aim is to have you end the semester having built something you can enjoy and be proud of. 

This is NOT designed to have you stress or focus so much on quizzes or exam grades. As long as I see that you are putting effort into the class and applying the feedback I give you, you will earn a good grade in the course. The only way you will fail the course is if you do not try.

Since most of you are CS majors, this is definitely a course you want to put effort into as it will build the foundation for the rest of your 
courses. 

I stress this, be willing to fail and be willing to fail 1000+ times. When you learn something new, you are a beginner, and you might feel stupid and that's completely okay. Embrace the process. One day you will look back and see how much you have grown. 

# Attendance
Please try your best to attend every lecture. If you cannot attend a lecture, just send me an email or talk to me after class - it's not a huge deal as lectures are recorded. Attending lectures are just one way I can see that you are putting in effort. Put it this way, you would tell your manager that you would have to miss a day of work, so you should do the same with your instructors. This also helps us (instructors) gauge if you are doing okay, if we need to reach out or provide you extra help, etc. I get very concerned when I see that students stop attending class. For students that have a 30+ minute commute there is the option of attending over zoom. If you live closer to campus I would prefer you attend in person if possible, but I understand that life happens.


If you feel as though you are a more advanced student and would like to accelerate through the course, that's completely fine too - just let me know!

# Late policy
For accountability reasons, I expect that you try your best to turn in assignments on time. Of course, life happens. If you feel as though you cannot turn in an assignment on time please email me. I tend to be a bit more lax with the late policy in terms of point deduction, but if late assignments are a recurring trend or if you turn in an assignment 2+ weeks late I will have to deduct late points. 

# Assignment submission
Unless otherwise stated, please submit a .docx or pdf file containing:
- a screenshot of your code running
- a link to the file in your github repository
